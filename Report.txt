This pipeline detects an underwater gate by processing each video frame through a sequence of classical computer vision steps that focus on geometric structure rather than visual appearance. The process starts with green-channel thresholding, which is effective underwater because green wavelengths are less attenuated compared to red and blue. This step suppresses background variations and highlights rigid, man-made structures. Morphological filtering is then applied to reduce noise caused by water movement, reflections, and lighting variations while preserving long, continuous shapes.

From the cleaned image, tall rectangular contours are extracted to identify potential vertical gate posts. In parallel, the Hough Line Transform is used to detect dominant straight lines in the scene and classify them based on orientation. Instead of treating contours and lines independently, the pipeline evaluates their spatial alignment, checking whether detected lines lie close to the edges of the rectangular structures and form a consistent gate-like geometry.

This approach works well in underwater environments because it relies on structural consistency, which remains stable even when color, texture, and illumination vary significantly. By combining region-based detection with global line geometry, the pipeline reduces false detections caused by noise or reflections and remains robust to partial occlusion and perspective distortion. This makes it suitable for reliable real-time gate detection in autonomous underwater navigation tasks.
